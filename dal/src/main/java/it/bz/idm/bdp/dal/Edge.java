/**
 * This class is a model of an edge with meta data.
 *
 * <p>We do not want to change the API for v2, hence we need to keep edges
 * as stations to retrieve "edge labels" with station API calls. This means that we use
 * "station" as container class.
 *
 * <p> An edge is therefore a station-triple like <code>(origin, destination, edge_data)</code>,
 * and some additional information, like directed, which describes if the edge has a direction, and
 * a line-geometry, which describe trajectories on a map. Some polylines on a map are not connected
 * to any station, therefore we need to make "origin" and "destination" optional, that is, nullable.
